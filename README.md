## 🚀 How It Works: Step-by-Step Example

Let's walk through exactly how the system transforms raw data into professional ad campaigns using **PIMCO** as our example:

### **📊 Step 1: Data Input**
```
Input File: URL_and_news_articles_examples_by_client.xlsx
- PIMCO URL: https://www.pimco.com/us/en/insights/fed-policymakers-split-decision

- T. Rowe Price URL: https://www.troweprice.com/en/institutional/capabilities
- 265+ financial news articles embedded in vector database
```

### **🕷️ Step 2: Web Scraping**
```python
# System scrapes PIMCO's landing page
Scraped Content (sample):
"SPDR® Gold MiniShares® Trust, sustainable investing screening, 
ESG capabilities, environmental social governance solutions, 
institutional investment strategies..."

Result: 20,156 characters of landing page content
```

### **🧠 Step 3: RAG Processing & Vector Database**
```python
# System builds FAISS vector database with 265 total embeddings
Vector Database: 384-dimensional embeddings using Sentence-BERT
Embedding Model: "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

# For PIMCO (Fed policy focus - 2025 updated):

✅ "SRI Redefined: Going Beyond Socially Responsible Investing" → Score: 0.50
✅ "Sustainable investing: How does it work and can my money support green issues?" → Score: 0.49

# For T. Rowe Price (2025 Market Outlook focus):
Query: "emerging markets investment strategy portfolio management equity post globalization deglobalization 2025 outlook"
Themes: ['market_outlook', 'investment_strategy', 'emerging_markets', 'global_trends', 'esg_outcomes']
Semantic Search Results:
